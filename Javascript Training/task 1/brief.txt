Create a page with a google map.

This is a very common feature and fairly straight forward to implement and there are docs available.

Objectives

1) Map on page
2) Set the map centre and zoom to something sensible
3) Add multiple pins on the map
4) Support X amounts of maps on one page.
5) Works in IE 8, Firefox and Chrome

Notes

We want to avoid any server side tech for these examples so any mapping data can be hardcoded Json.
All Javascript can be inline if needed, jQuery acceptable but no mapping plugins.

This style may be helpful if you're hopeless at css

<style type=text/css>
	.map { width: 600px; height: 400px; }
</style>
