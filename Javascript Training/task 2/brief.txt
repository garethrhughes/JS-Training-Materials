Create a page with simple ajax tabs

The tabs will display different text based on an ajax request. 

Objectives

1) At least 3 tabs
2) Should be extensible, not needing excessive JS to add more tabs.
3) Attach an event to a link in one of the tabs that alerts "hello"
4) Have a link in a tab which opens a new window
5) Works in IE 8, Firefox and Chrome

-- bonus points if the content fades out then back in

Notes

Ajax can request plain HTML files to avoid server side tech.
Tabs can be simply a list of unstyled items that you can click.
Use latest jQuery for this exercise.
